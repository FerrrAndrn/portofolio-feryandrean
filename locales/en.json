The server enforces role-based access through JWT authentication, ensuring staff, managers, and administrators only access features appropriate to their roles. Administrators have full control over user accounts, inventory data, and request histories, while managers handle approvals and staff focus on submitting requests. With features such as CRUD operations, history tracking, and request statistics, the server ensures secure, transparent, and efficient inventory management across platforms.",

  "details": {
    "overview": "The Automatic Curtain Control System is an IoT prototype developed as a smart home automation project. It uses an ATmega16 microcontroller programmed in C to control curtain movement based on ambient light intensity. An LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) sensor continuously detects light levels, and the system automatically opens or closes the curtain by driving a servo motor. This allows natural sunlight optimization during the day and privacy at night, reducing the need for manual curtain operation. The system was designed, simulated, and tested using Proteus before being implemented as a working hardware prototype, showcasing integration between sensors, microcontrollers, and actuators in a real-world environment.",
